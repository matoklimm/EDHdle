    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>1. General Information</h2>

    <p>
        EDHdle is a personal, non-commercial side project.<br>
        Protecting your privacy is important to me.<br>
        This page explains what data is collected and how it is used.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>In short:</strong>
        EDHdle does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or process any personal data on a server.
    </p>

    <h2>2. No Personal Data Collection</h2>

    <p>
        EDHdle does <strong>not</strong>:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>require user accounts</li>
        <li>collect names, email addresses, or identifiers</li>
        <li>use tracking, analytics, or advertising services</li>
        <li>use cookies for tracking purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        No personal data is transmitted to or stored on any backend server.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Local Storage Usage</h2>

    <p>
        EDHdle uses your browser’s <strong>localStorage</strong> to improve the gameplay experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        This includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>storing your guesses for the current game mode</li>
        <li>remembering your progress for the daily puzzle</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This data:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>stays entirely on your device</li>
        <li>is never sent to a server</li>
        <li>can be deleted at any time by clearing your browser data</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Local storage is required for the game to function correctly.
    </p>

    <h2>4. External Resources (Card Images)</h2>

    <p>
        Card images are loaded directly from <strong>Scryfall’s CDN</strong> (<code>*.scryfall.io</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
        When images are loaded, your browser may transmit technical information such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>browser type</li>
        <li>operating system</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This is standard behavior when loading external images and is governed by
        Scryfall’s own privacy policy.
        No additional data is shared by EDHdle.
    </p>

    <h2>5. External Links</h2>

    <p>
        EDHdle contains links to external websites, including:

        When you follow these links, the respective provider’s privacy policy applies.<br>
        EDHdle has no control over external websites.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Cookies</h2>

    <p>
        EDHdle does <strong>not</strong> set any cookies for tracking or analytics.
    </p>

        EDHdle does not knowingly collect any personal data from children.
        Since no personal data is collected at all, this website is safe for all ages.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
