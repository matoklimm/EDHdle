    <h1>EDHdle ✨</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>EDHdle</strong> is a daily guessing game inspired by
        <em>Pokedle</em>, <em>LoLdle</em> and other popular guessing games. 🎲
    </p>

    <p>
        Test your Commander knowledge in different game modes —
        from artwork and oracle text to metadata like colors, CMC and rank.
        A new puzzle is available <strong>every day.</strong> 🧠
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sources</h2>

    <p>
        EDHdle is based on the <strong>Top 100 most played Commander cards</strong>
        listed on <a href="https://edhrec.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EDHREC</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Only the card names and ranking positions are taken from EDHREC.
        EDHdle does <strong>not</strong> crawl EDHREC and does <strong>not</strong> use
        their API at runtime.
    </p>

    <p>
        All card data (colors, types, oracle text, artwork, etc.) is fetched from
        <a href="https://scryfall.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scryfall</a>
        using a one-time offline script.
    </p>

    <p>
        The generated data is bundled with the application.
        No external card APIs are called while playing the game.<br>
        The dataset used by EDHdle was generated and processed on
        <strong>January 8, 2026</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Rankings and card popularity may change over time as the Commander meta evolves.
        Therefore, I plan to regularly refresh and process the data to keep the dataset up to date.
        The current plan is a refresh roughly every four weeks.
    </p>

    <h2>Card Images</h2>

    <p>
        Card images are provided by Scryfall and loaded via direct image URLs
        from their CDN.
    </p>

    <p>
        Images are used in accordance with
        <a href="https://scryfall.com/docs/api" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            Scryfall’s image usage guidelines
        </a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The background image(s) are downloaded from the official Wizards of the Coast
        <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/de/news#wallpapers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wallpaper website</a>

    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        EDHdle is a personal side project. 👋<br>
        Professionally, I mostly work on backend and distributed systems,
        so building a small frontend-heavy game like this was a fun new experience —
        and a great way to combine my passion for EDH with software development.
